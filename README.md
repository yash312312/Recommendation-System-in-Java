# Recommendation-System-in-Java
A DIY version of Netflix and Amazon recommendation system. 
In this project we did following things to get personalized recommendation
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
